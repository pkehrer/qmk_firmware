This is a stop on my journey towards a full hand-wired custom layout keyboard. 

Keyboard Maintainer: [pkehrer](https://github.com/pkehrer)  
Hardware Supported: Works with my custom hand-wired pro-micro controller  
Hardware Availability: [The pro micro I used](https://keeb.io/collections/split-keyboard-parts/products/pro-micro-5v-16mhz-arduino-compatible-atmega32u4)


Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make pkehrerpad:default

See [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/build_environment_setup.html) then the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/make_instructions.html) for more information.
